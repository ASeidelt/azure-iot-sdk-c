Connection and Messaging Reliability</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md53"></a>
Overview</h2>
<p>In this document you will find information about the reliability aspects of the <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c">Azure IoT C SDK</a> design, including details of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connection authentication/refresh;</li>
<li>How connection failures are detected;</li>
<li>The reconnection logic;</li>
<li>Available options for fine-tuning reconnection (retry policies, timeouts);</li>
<li>Notifications of IoT Hub connection status (status callbacks);</li>
<li>What happens to previously queued and new messages;</li>
<li>Specific behaviors of the supported transport-protocols (AMQP, MQTT, HTTP).</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md54"></a>
Connection Authentication</h2>
<p>This is a brief note to clarify how authentication is done in the IoTHub Device/Module clients.</p>
<p>Authentication of a client in the SDK can be done using either</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-security#security-tokens">SAS tokens</a>, or</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-security#supported-x509-certificates">x509 certificates</a>, or</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-dps/">Device Provisioning Service</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This section does not describe the details of Device Provisioning Service (DPS), please use the link above for details.</p>
<p>When using SAS tokens, authentication can be done by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-security#authentication">your own SAS token</a>, or</li>
<li>Giving the device keys to the SDK (using the device connection string - see <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-device-sdk-c-iothubclient#alternate-device-credentials">"Alternate Device Credentials"</a> in our documentation) and letting it create the SAS tokens for you (this is the most usual authentication method).</li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned in the articles above, SAS tokens have an expiration time.</p>
<p>The Azure IoT SDK connection then generates and sends new SAS tokens periodically to the IoT Hub to keep the connection authenticated.</p>
<p>The internal behaviour is different depending on the transport protocol used:</p>
<table class="markdownTable">
<tr class="markdownTableHead">
<th class="markdownTableHeadNone"><b>Transport</b>   </th><th class="markdownTableHeadNone"><b>Behaviour</b>    </th></tr>
<tr class="markdownTableRowOdd">
<td class="markdownTableBodyNone">MQTT   </td><td class="markdownTableBodyNone">SAS tokens are valid for 1 hour, and a new one is sent every 48 minutes. Every time a new SAS token needs to be sent, the client will disconnect from the Azure IoT Hub and reconnect.    </td></tr>
<tr class="markdownTableRowEven">
<td class="markdownTableBodyNone">AMQP   </td><td class="markdownTableBodyNone">SAS tokens are valid for 1 hour, and a new one is sent every 48 minutes. Client is not disconnected when a new SAS token is sent.    </td></tr>
<tr class="markdownTableRowOdd">
<td class="markdownTableBodyNone">HTTP   </td><td class="markdownTableBodyNone">There is no persistent connection; a new SAS token (valid for 1 hour) is created and sent with each request to the Azure IoT Hub.   </td></tr>
</table>
<p>Both the SAS token lifetime and refresh rate are configurable on AMQP transport (see <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/2019-03-18/doc/Iothub_sdk_options.md#amqp-transport">AMQP transport section</a> in SDK options documentation).</p>

</table>
<p>When an Azure IoT device client instance is created, this is the typical* sequence within the SDK:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>User creates a new device client instance using, e.g., IoTHubClient_CreateFromConnectionString;</li>
<li>The device client instance creates a transport protocol instance based on the selection from the user (AMQP_Protocol, <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/2018-05-04/iothub_client/inc/iothubtransportmqtt.h#L13">MQTT_Protocol</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/2018-05-04/iothub_client/inc/iothubtransportamqp_websockets.h#L15">AMQP_Protocol_over_WebSocketsTls</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/2018-05-04/iothub_client/inc/iothubtransportmqtt_websockets.h#L15">MQTT_WebSocket_Protocol</a> or <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/2018-05-04/iothub_client/inc/iothubtransporthttp.h#L14">HTTP_Protocol</a>);</li>
<li>The transport protocol then creates:<ul>
<li>A tlsio_* instance based on the system where it is running (by default Schannel on Windows and openssl on Linux), and</li>
<li>An instance of the application protocol specific API (uamqp, <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-umqtt-c">umqtt</a>, httpapi), passing as argument the tlsio_* instance created above.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The protocol API instance then uses the tlsio_* to establish the secure connection with the Azure IoT Hub<ul>
<li>The socket creation and connection happens within the tlsio_* layer.</li>
<li>The sequence shown is different if using specific features like device multiplexing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Each of these layers provide status and error events to the above through function returns and callbacks. Connection issues are detected in three different ways accross the SDK:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Through persistent device-to-cloud message I/O failures;</li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>Which can be, for example: </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>uAMQP or uMQTT reporting failures when sending:</li>
<li>Telemetry messages;</li>
<li>Device Twin reported property updates;</li>
<li>Keep-alive messages they frequently send to the Azure IoT Hub;</li>
</ul>
<p>Transport protocol detecting timeouts waiting for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Telemetry messages to complete sending;</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-security#security-tokens">CBS authentication token</a> refresh to be completed.</li>
</ul>
<p>Through failures reported by the socket APIs;</p>
<ul>
<li>On send() and/or receive() failures;</li>
<li>On signals raised by the socket API (different operating systems report failures faster than others, resulting in corresponding speed of detection by the device client SDK).</li>
</ul>
<p>Through graceful disconnection notifications from the Azure IoT Hub.</p>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>Which can happen when a hub is preparing for a system update, for example (upon reconnection the device client automatically gets routed to the next available Hub). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some aspects of the detection of connection issues are specific to the transport protocol used, as shown in the table:</p>
<table class="markdownTable">
<tr class="markdownTableHead">

<tr class="markdownTableRowEven">
<td class="markdownTableBodyNone">MQTT   </td><td class="markdownTableBodyNone">Besides regular detection through callbacks from uMQTT, the MQTT protocol transport will attempt to publish messages up to <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/2018-05-04/iothub_client/src/iothubtransport_mqtt_common.c#L46">two times</a> (waiting <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/2018-05-04/iothub_client/src/iothubtransport_mqtt_common.c#L45">60 seconds</a> between attempts) before raising a failure.    </td></tr>
<tr class="markdownTableRowOdd">
<td class="markdownTableBodyNone">HTTP   </td><td class="markdownTableBodyNone">HTTP connections to the Azure IoT Hub are not persistent. Each outgoing message to the hub results in a new connection and is closed as soon as the I/O is completed.

If connection failures occur, the protocol transport simply keeps retrying the operation until it succeeds.   </td></tr>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md56"></a>
The Connection Retry Logic</h2>
<p>Once a connection issue is detected, the transport protocol will initiate its connection retry logic. The process is as follows:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Connection is marked as faulty by the protocol transport (through the ways described above);</li>
<li>Transport prepares for re-connection;</li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>a. Pending outgoing messages are properly handled; </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>No messages are ever lost; they are either:<ul>
<li>Re-sent after a new connection is successfully reestablished, or</li>
<li>Returned to the user as failed through the completion callbacks;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>b. Connection components are destroyed; </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>That includes destroying the uAMQP or uMQTT components (sessions, links, connection for AMQP; topic subscriptions for MQTT) and tlsio_* instance (and its internal socket connection)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>c. Connection Status Callback is invoked (if subscribed); </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>More details are available on the <a href="file:///C:\repos\s1\azure-iot-sdk-c\doc\connection-and-messaging-reliability.md#Connection-Status-Callback">"Connection Status Callback"</a> sub-section below.</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>Retry Policy is checked to determine if a reconnection attempt shall be attempted;</li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>More details are explained in the <a href="file:///C:\repos\s1\azure-iot-sdk-c\doc\connection-and-messaging-reliability.md#Connection-Retry-Policies">"Connection Retry Policies"</a> sub-section below. </p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li>If the Retry Policy allows, a re-connection is attempted;</li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>If the Retry Policy requires to wait before an attempt can be made, the protocol transport delays the re-connection, starting again from <b>step 3</b> afterwards. </p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li>If the re-connection attempt fails, start again from <b>step 2.</b></li>
<li>Upon successful re-connection, all these additional steps are taken by the SDK:<ul>
<li>Previous subscriptions made by the user for cloud-to-device messages (Commands, Device Methods, Device Twin Desired Properties) are automatically reestablished, requiring no additional action (the SDK continues to use the same callback functions previously set);</li>
<li>Pending outgoing messages start to be sent again to the Azure IoT Hub;</li>
<li>Connection Status Callback is invoked (if subscribed).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md57"></a>
Behavior of the Device Client SDK while Re-Connecting</h2>
<p>The Azure IoT Device Client C SDK implements asynchronous operations through the *_DoWork() model it uses.</p>
<p>All API functions that result in I/O (like <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/2018-05-04/iothub_client/inc/iothub_client_ll.h#L354"><em>IoTHubClient_LL_SendEventAsync</em></a> or <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/2018-05-04/iothub_client/inc/iothub_client_ll.h#L385"><em>IoTHubClient_LL_SetMessageCallback</em></a>) are actually queued or stored, taking effect only when <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/2018-05-04/iothub_client/inc/iothub_client_ll.h#L461"><em>IoTHubClient_LL_DoWork</em></a> is invoked* AND the connection with the Azure IoT Hub is established.</p>
<ul>
<li>IoTHubClient_LL_DoWork is invoked internally automatically if using the iothub_client multi-threaded API.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, while the device client is in re-connection mode,</p>
<ul>
<li>New Telemetry messages passed to the SDK will be queued (but still subject to the message-send timeout even during reconnection);</li>
<li>New subscriptions for cloud-to-device messages (e.g., Commands) will be stored, but result in an actual request for subscription to the Azure IoT Hub only the device client re-connects.</li>
</ul>
<p>For clarity it is worth mentioning that while the Azure IoT Device Client is re-connecting, it has no means to receive any messages from the Azure IoT Hub. During that time any attempts to send Commands or invoke Device Methods to the given device client (using for example the <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/tree/2018-05-04/iothub_service_client">Azure IoT Service Client C SDK</a>) will result in failure returned by the Azure IoT Hub to the source of those requests.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md58"></a>
Timeout Controls over Outgoing Messages</h2>
<p>Besides checking for error returns and responding to callbacks from lower its layers, the Azure IoT Device Client C SDK also implements extra logic to detect failures by tracking timeouts. They apply to different functionalities within the SDK, each with a specific course of action in case</p>
<ul>
<li>Connections complete in time (including TLS negotiation);</li>
<li>Messages (e.g., Telemetry, Twin reported properties) are sent within the expected time range;</li>
<li>Authentication refreshes are done with the expected frequency.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the time-outs can be fine-tuned by the user (through IoTHubClient_LL_SetOption). Some are dependent on the application protocol selected (AMQP, MQTT or HTTP).</p>
<p>Details about the specific timeout control values that can be set by the user can be found on the <a href="file:///C:\repos\s1\azure-iot-sdk-c\doc\connection-and-messaging-reliability.md#Current-Configuration-Options">"Current Configuration Options"</a> sub-section bellow.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md59"></a>
Known Issue: Duplicated Timeout Control for Sending Telemetry Messages</h2>
<p>Currently the Azure IoT Device Client C SDK implements a queue for pending outgoing Telemetry messages that is owned by the iothub_client_ll layer.</p>
<p>Any new Telemetry messages passed to the SDK by the user (through ) are copied and immediatelly stored in that queue.</p>
<p>That same queue is shared with the protocol transport, which treats it as a "waiting to send" list. The protocol transport also has its own queue for Telemetry messages, but this one is only for messages that are already being sent (i.e., have been processed and passed down to the protocol API module).</p>
<p>The protocol transport at some point (namely, right when IoTHubClient_LL_DoWork is invoked) removes messages in the "waiting to send" list (in the order they were added), converts them to the format understood by the protocol API layer, then adds the pair to its "in progress" list.</p>
<p>Once the lower layer calls back with the send completion notification the protocol transport removes the specific message from its "in progress" list and bubbles it (along with the send result) to the user (through the callback provided).</p>
<p>There are two timeout controls in this system. An original one in the iothub_client_ll layer - which controls the "waiting to send" queue - and a modern one in the protocol transport layer - that applies to the "in progress" list. However, since IoTHubClient_LL_DoWork causes the Telemetry messages to be immediately* processed, sent and moved to the "in progress" list, the first timeout control is virtually non-applicable.</p>
<p>Both can be fine-tuned by users through IoTHubClient_LL_SetOption, and because of that removing the original control could cause a break for existing customers. For that reason it has been kept as is, but it will be re-designed when we move to the next major version of the product.</p>
<p>For now, new customers should set both options if using the iothub_client_ll module, or just the protocol transport one if using the iothub_client module.</p>
<ul>
<li>Depends on how frequently IoTHubClient_LL_DoWork is invoked. On the iothub_client (threaded) layer, it is invoked every one-hundred milliseconds.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md60"></a>
Connection Retry Policies</h2>
<p>Some times the connection issues, although transient, can last longer than expected, or network availability can bounce on and off for a while after it first returns.</p>
<p>Attempting to reconnect to the Azure IoT Hub immediatelly in a loop is not the most efficient way for the device client SDK to operate, since some of the initial attempts might fail because of the reasons above.</p>
<p>As shown above on <a href="file:///C:\repos\s1\azure-iot-sdk-c\doc\connection-and-messaging-reliability.md#The-Connection-Retry-Logic">"The Connection Retry Logic"</a> (step 3), the protocol transport checks if the current retry policy allows it to attempt to re-connect to the Azure IoT Hub.</p>
<p>The Retry Policy feature exposes a way to control how immediatelly and frequently the Azure IoT Device Client C SDK will attempt to re-connect to the Azure IoT Hub in case a connection issue occurs.</p>
<p>The logic is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Within the transport protocol there is the Retry Control, a the dedicated module for handling Retry Policy matters;</li>
<li>The transport control checks if the Retry Control allows it to reconnect at a given moment;</li>
<li>The Retry Control will calculate the current wait time based on the Retry Policy currently set on the SDK (see more on the table below), and indicate;<ul>
<li>That a re-connection can be immediatelly attempted; OR</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>In such case the protocol transport will attempt reconnecting.</p>
<p>If if succeeds, it will instruct the Retry Control to reset its counters, and the next wait times it calculates will start fresh from the initial base time.</p>
<p>If the re-connection attempt fails the protocol transport will continue checking with the Retry Control if it can try again. Depending on the Retry Policy currently set this next wait time calculated by the Retry Control can be longer (and similarly along with the next wait times calculated), aiming at easing out the frequency with which the device client attempts to reconnect. That gives a chance for the network (at the Operating System level) to get back to its normal availability. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>That the transport protocol must wait for a while to attempt re-connecting; OR</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>The transport protocol will continue to check with the Retry Control if it is time to attempt re-connecting (until it is finally allowed or denied). </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>That no re-connections should be attempted anymore.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>The Retry Policies are composed by a algorithm to calculate the wait times in between reconnection attempts, as well as a maximum time for the total ammount of consecutive tries (see argument "retryTimeoutLimitInSeconds" on the functions below).</p>
<p>If this timeout is reached, the Retry Control will instruct the transport protocol to not re-connect anymore. In this scenario a Connection Status notification is raised and the user application is made aware of that. Some customers use this aspect of the feature to perform manual intervention in case re-connections have been failing consecutivelly for long periods (e.g., 24 hours or more), possibly indicating more serious network issues.</p>
<p>One important detail is that the protocol transport never ceases checking with the Retry Control if it can attempt to re-connect again, even when it is told not to try anymore. In that case, if during execution time the user changes the current Retry Policy (see below for details) the Retry Control gets reset, giving the opportunity for the device client to start attemping to re-connect again. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Currently the default Retry Policy in the Azure IoT Device Client C SDK is IOTHUB_CLIENT_RETRY_EXPONENTIAL_BACKOFF_WITH_JITTER (with no timeout), but it can be set by using the following SDK function:</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/2018-05-04/iothub_client/inc/iothub_client.h#L188">iothub_client module</a>:</p>

Connection Status Callback</h2>
<p>The Azure IoT Device Client C SDK provides a callback option to notify the upper application layer if it is connected to the Azure IoT Hub or not, followed by a standardized reason.</p>
<p>To access it the user can invoke one of the functions below, passing a callback function.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/2018-05-04/iothub_client/inc/iothub_client.h#L171">iothub_client</a> module:</p>

<p>This callback will be invoked in these specific situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>When the device client gets connected or re-connected to the Azure IoT Hub;</li>
<li>When the device client gets disconnected due to any issues;</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>These include network availability and IoT hub connectivity issues, authentication failures. </p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>When the device client ceases attempting to re-connect (if the Retry Policy no longer allows to).</li>
</ul>
<p>Please take a look <a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdk-c/blob/2018-05-04/iothub_client/inc/iothub_client_ll.h#L144">here</a> for more info on the possible status and reasons.</p>
